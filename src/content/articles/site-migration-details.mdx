title: Website v2 to v3 Migration Details
subtitle: Some technical details, and notes for myself.

I was meaning to write up some quick notes for myself on the subtle changes I have made in the way I am formatting my site when migrating from v2 (the Jekyll version) to v3 (with AstroJS). Most relevant is the differences in the frontmatter -- variable names, conventions, etc.

A funny thing I realised is that I could include these notes in this website itself, and this can serve as a test document during development. This is an easteregg of sorts since I don't think I will un-draft (and thus publish) this article, but it will be accessible in the source code.

Anyway (old -> new):

- `redirect_from`: Use redirects in astro.config.mjs
- `image`: `thumb`
- `feature`: I think I will do the home page bespoke, so this is not needed
- `description`: `subtitle`
- `links`: new link format

images should be stored in `res/content/<slug>/` rather than `passets/<#>/` (I can't believe I numbered stuff like that rather than using the slug, not very good for maintainability).
