Is it possible to parse a natural language (plain English) question and gather relevant information for it from the internet using Natural Language Processing techniques? AnswerBot is the answer. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pixelchai/AnswerBot).

AnswerBot is, put simply, a search engine. You input a question, it parses it using the NLP techniques of Part-Of-Speech tagging and dependency parsing and then searches through Wikipedia, making use of semantic similarity calculations, to gather information to answer the input. The NLP functionalities just mentioned are provided by the Python library, [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/).

# Background Information

### Semantic Similarity

How similar two things are in terms of the meanings of their words.

### Part-Of-Speech tagging

Words in some text are categorised into whether they are a noun or a verb, etc (their part of speech).

### Dependency parsing

In terms of linguistics, the words in a sentence can be thought of as being linked to each other as dependencies. Dependency parsing means parsing and categorising how the words in a sentence relate and link to each other.

Above is a visualisation of dependency parsing and POS tagging. You can visualise your own sentences on [the DisplaCy website](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy).

Note: there is one word from which all other words are linked either directly or indirectly. This is called the `root`. In this case, it’s the word “sat”.

# Question Parsing

What needs to be extracted from the input is terms, categorised into being either ’detail’ or ‘keywords’.

When does a ‘detail’ stop being just additional information and start being a ‘keyword’, though? It isn’t as binary as you might first think - and resolving terms to be strictly either may result in a less complete representation of the question and so in inaccuracies. For this reason, I decided to take a fuzzy approach and arrange the terms into a linear hierarchal list (aka: a spectrum) of relative ‘detail’-ness (dependency/importance) instead.

Internally, this structure shall be represented by a list of terms, where ‘keyword’-like terms emerge at the left and the ‘detail’-like emerge at the right.

| Natural Language                       | Abstract Hierarchy                |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Obama’s age                            | `["Obama", "age"]`                |
| Obama’s dad’s age                      | `["Obama", "dad", "age"]`         |
| the biggest animal ever seen in Europe | `["Europe", "animal", "biggest"]` |

Note: Google Search has a feature similar to what is trying to be achieved here called `Featured Snippets` (image below), which seems to make use of a similar hierarchal structure (see underlined).
